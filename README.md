# What problem do we solve?

Bal Asha is having trouble scaling and handling the adoption process for every child in the spotlight. It's difficult to give one employee the responsibility of managing every distinct adoption case. The existing method is not scalable and makes it challenging to ensure that each kid receives a thorough adoption process. This difficulty makes it difficult for Bal Asha to manage the growing number of youngsters in need of adoption.
